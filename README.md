This project seeks to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs. Using a multi-layered neural network, the code is able to train on a set of files, test itself, then perform predictions. It correctly identities cats and dogs as tested by the programmers.

Please Note: Due to Github's storage limitations, the full testing/training set could not be uploaded to this repository. If you wish to run the program at full capacity, please download the Cats V Dogs dataset from Kaggle and run the python file locally on your machine with the correct imports.

This project requires the following file system structure to run properly:

generic Folder

'dataset' folder, catdog_NeuralNet.py

'single_prediction', 'smalltest', 'smalltraining'

When the program runs you will prompted to input the file name which you are testing against the machine, this file should be in the 'single_prediction' folder. Enter the filename within quotes ex. 'test.jpg'
